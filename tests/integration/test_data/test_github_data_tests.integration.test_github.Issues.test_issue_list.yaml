        you were right, it''s possible to do this. I just realized that osbs squashes
        all layers. Therefore we should be able to:\r\n\r\n1. detect if a label from
        the set is defined\r\n2. check if it''s overriden in every subsequent layer\r\n\r\nOptimization
        detail: try as hard to do this via API without doing `docker save` -- that''s
        one very expensive operation -- we should be able to accomplish this just
        by doing inspect on all layers.\r\n\r\nJust got great pointers from @lcarva:\r\n\r\n    The
        only difference is for base images (rhel), because they will have 2 layers.
        \r\n    We do store Dockefiles for each image in hierarchy under /root/build-info
        if that''s useful.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/issues/232","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/issues/232/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/issues/232/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/issues/232/events","html_url":"https://github.com/user-cont/colin/issues/232","id":446597945,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDY1OTc5NDU=","number":232,"title":"new

        label. If it doesn''t, those label values will refer to the parent image and
        so will be inaccurate.\r\n\r\nTo do this the check needs simultaneous access
        to both the container image and the Dockerfile which was used to build it.
        For this I''ve added a new target and check type, \"image+dockerfile\".\r\n\r\nPlease
        advise on whether this seems like the right approach.\r\n\r\nThanks!"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/issues/228","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/issues/228/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/issues/228/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/issues/228/events","html_url":"https://github.com/user-cont/colin/pull/228","id":438744137,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjc0NzAzODA0","number":228,"title":"Packit

        you were right, it''s possible to do this. I just realized that osbs squashes
        all layers. Therefore we should be able to:\r\n\r\n1. detect if a label from
        the set is defined\r\n2. check if it''s overriden in every subsequent layer\r\n\r\nOptimization
        detail: try as hard to do this via API without doing `docker save` -- that''s
        one very expensive operation -- we should be able to accomplish this just
        by doing inspect on all layers.\r\n\r\nJust got great pointers from @lcarva:\r\n\r\n    The
        only difference is for base images (rhel), because they will have 2 layers.
        \r\n    We do store Dockefiles for each image in hierarchy under /root/build-info
        if that''s useful.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/issues/232","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/issues/232/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/issues/232/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/issues/232/events","html_url":"https://github.com/user-cont/colin/issues/232","id":446597945,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDY1OTc5NDU=","number":232,"title":"new

        Ideally, the tool would implemented everything but it''s possible that some
        rules might be hard to automate.\r\n  * The output from colin should be easy
        to ready and meant to be pasted inside bugzilla when a review for container
        image is requested.\r\n  * When working on this part, please open a new issue
        where we, as upstream maintainers, discuss:\r\n    * List of rules to implement.\r\n    *
        Implementation details.\r\n  * Once the design is approved, feel free to continue
        with implementation.\r\n* [Project Atomic Container Best Practices](https://github.com/projectatomic/container-best-practices/)
        support\r\n  * Select at least 5 important rules from the best practices and
        implement automated checks inside colin for those (implement 5 more as a stretch
        goal).\r\n  * The checks should be diverse, please discuss your plans with
        us first.\r\n* Fedora deployment\r\n  * Once colin is running smoothly locally
        and is able to check selected container images, we can start preparing for
        integration inside Fedora Infrastructure.\r\n  * Open an issue at selected
        Fedora trackers (Fedora-infra, Fedora QE) what we want to do and how can we
        achieve that.\r\n  * Once the infrastructure team approves our plans, we can
        realize them.\r\n* Report\r\n  * Great work needs marketing.\r\n  * After
        running it in production, write a report on fedora-devel (and other mailing
        lists) on what colin found in container images built inside Fedora infrastructure

        is something I deeply care about that why I''m such a PITA about it.\r\n\r\nAfter
        I tried colin recently, I was overwhelmed by the output: there was too much
        info for me and it wasn''t easy to read. One suggestion I have here is to
        color only lines such as `nok:failed:bzcomponent_deprecated` and not the description.\r\n\r\nThe
        other thing I''m thinking about is the line itself; would it be better to
        have something like this?\r\n```\r\nfailed   Deprecated label BZComponent
        is used.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince we have almighty @jpopelka on our team now, I
        have an idea: Jirko, would you be so kind and played with colin a bit a tell
        us your opinion about the output and your user experience?\r\n\r\nFranto,
        I understand if you are now like \"what the funk is this guy''s problem\",
        but as I said, I would love if colin had an awesome output which suits everyone
        and the tool is such a pleasure to be used. I think we are heading there,
        I just want to make sure we get there.

        [Fedora Container Guidelines](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Container:Guidelines)
        support\r\n  * First thing to implement is to add new checks inside colin
        which verify that the provided container image fulfils Fedora Container Guidelines\r\n  *
        Ideally, the tool would implemented everything but it''s possible that some
        rules might be hard to automate.\r\n  * The output from colin should be easy
        to ready and meant to be pasted inside bugzilla when a review for container
        image is requested.\r\n  * When working on this part, please open a new issue
        where we, as upstream maintainers, discuss:\r\n    * List of rules to implement.\r\n    *
        Implementation details.\r\n  * Once the design is approved, feel free to continue
        with implementation.\r\n* [Project Atomic Container Best Practices](https://github.com/projectatomic/container-best-practices/)
        support\r\n  * Select at least 5 important rules from the best practices and
        implement automated checks inside colin for those (implement 5 more as a stretch
        goal).\r\n  * The checks should be diverse, please discuss your plans with
        us first.\r\n* Fedora deployment\r\n  * Once colin is running smoothly locally
        and is able to check selected container images, we can start preparing for
        integration inside Fedora Infrastructure.\r\n  * Open an issue at selected
        Fedora trackers (Fedora-infra, Fedora QE) what we want to do and how can we
        achieve that.\r\n  * Once the infrastructure team approves our plans, we can
        realize them.\r\n* Report\r\n  * Great work needs marketing.\r\n  * After
        running it in production, write a report on fedora-devel (and other mailing
        lists) on what colin found in container images built inside Fedora infrastructure
        with a summary."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/issues/5","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/issues/5/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/issues/5/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/issues/5/events","html_url":"https://github.com/user-cont/colin/pull/5","id":304759455,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTc0NjU1Njc5","number":5,"title":"Name

        is something I deeply care about that why I''m such a PITA about it.\r\n\r\nAfter
        I tried colin recently, I was overwhelmed by the output: there was too much
        info for me and it wasn''t easy to read. One suggestion I have here is to
        color only lines such as `nok:failed:bzcomponent_deprecated` and not the description.\r\n\r\nThe
        other thing I''m thinking about is the line itself; would it be better to
        have something like this?\r\n```\r\nfailed   Deprecated label BZComponent
        is used.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince we have almighty @jpopelka on our team now, I
        have an idea: Jirko, would you be so kind and played with colin a bit a tell
        us your opinion about the output and your user experience?\r\n\r\nFranto,
        I understand if you are now like \"what the funk is this guy''s problem\",
        but as I said, I would love if colin had an awesome output which suits everyone
        and the tool is such a pleasure to be used. I think we are heading there,
