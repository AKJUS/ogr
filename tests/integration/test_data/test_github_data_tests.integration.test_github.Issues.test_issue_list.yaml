        Improve saving responses.\r\n    - Use Singleton for `PersistentObjectStorage`.\r\n    -
        Enable saving responses by env-var (`RECORD_REQUESTS`).\r\n- Add support for
        authentication as a github-app.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### Usage:\r\n- Set
        `RECORD_REQUESTS` env. variable to turn it on and import services directly
        from ogr.\r\n    - Use `from ogr import PagureService`, not `from ogr.services.pagure
        import PagureService`.\r\n    - You can use the following code in the `__init__.py`
        to enable mocking for whole module:\r\n    ```python\r\n    import os\r\n    os.environ[\"RECORD_REQUESTS\"]
        = \"TRUE\"\r\n    ```\r\n- Set the storage file name before the test:\r\n    ```python\r\n    PersistentObjectStorage().storage_file
        = persistent_data_file\r\n    ```\r\n    - In OGR we are using file per test
        -- we have the following code in the `setUp` in `TestCase`:\r\n    ```python\r\n        test_name
        = self.id() or \"all\"\r\n        persistent_data_file = os.path.join(\r\n            PERSISTENT_DATA_PREFIX,

        = persistent_data_file\r\n    ```\r\n- You can use `PersistentObjectStorage().is_write_mode`
        to check the mode.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] docs\r\n- ~~[ ]
        fix the test for github-app~~ I am having some problems with python-crypto
        -- I can fix that later to not leave that here for so long.\r\n- ~~[ ] less

        \ When I tried to reimplement [release-bot's](https://github.com/user-cont/release-bot)\

        \ got stuck.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the examples could be comments. I want to\

        \ it works via graphQL and sending some `node_id` inside query which recognizes\
        \ a PR or an Issue. \\r\\n- In ogr there is `pr_comment` function in ogr/services/github.py.\
        \ If am I right this is an alternative I'm looking for. However, I don't fully\

        it fails because [Pagure.create_basic_url()](https://pagure.io/libpagure/blob/17e240ea337e6962aa660b0cfd174ef6309f4162/f/libpagure/libpagure.py#_115)

        problem is that [OurPagure.repo](https://pagure.io/libpagure/blob/17e240ea337e6962aa660b0cfd174ef6309f4162/f/libpagure/libpagure.py#_115)

        r\\nor this will also work ``FORCE_WRITE=yes GITHUB_TOKEN=yourtoken GITHUB_USER=yourname\

        \ When I tried to reimplement [release-bot's](https://github.com/user-cont/release-bot)\
        \ functionalities which communicate with Github via GraphQL or rest API I\
        \ got stuck.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the examples could be comments. I want to\
        \ implement commenting on Github issues and PRs via ogr. \\r\\n- In [release-bot](https://github.com/user-cont/release-bot)\
        \ it works via graphQL and sending some `node_id` inside query which recognizes\
        \ a PR or an Issue. \\r\\n- In ogr there is `pr_comment` function in ogr/services/github.py.\
        \ If am I right this is an alternative I'm looking for. However, I don't fully\
        \ understand the function's parameters since it needs something else then\
        \ API query.\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand that this could be a very complex problem\
        \ since ogr need to preserve compatibility with all git forges. I'm just looking\
