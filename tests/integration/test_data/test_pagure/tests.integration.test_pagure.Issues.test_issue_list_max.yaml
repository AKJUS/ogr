                              \ If you're expecting auto-generated tarballs, those\
                              \ are made upon request from the generator URL: `https://pagure.io/<repo>/archive/<tag>/<repo>-<version>.tar.gz`.\r\
                              \n\r\nThe name of the directory will be named after\
                              \ the base name of the tarball requested. So no changes\
                              \ to your tagging structure is required."

                              and assumes a specific tag convention. But the way the
                              underlying generator works, you _can_ get correctly
                              structured tarballs. This little feature is mostly designed
                              to deal with Java and GNOME packages that use sometimes-insane
                              tagging conventions (mostly CVS/SVN style tags for monorepos).

                              you, then go for that.

                              if enabled for the user, so it cannot just be removed
                              (unless we move the rebase action elsewhere).

                              I had _no idea_ there was a Rebase button **inside**
                              the merge button! (Hey, I said it makes me _want_ to
                              push it, not that I've actually pushed it.) I don't
                              think I'd ever have learned that, on my own.

                              ships with the pagure auth enabled by default, but that
                              still requires the user to manually edit `sshd_config`
                              and add the custom `AuthorizedKeysCommand` entry there.  It'd
                              be great if we could just flip a switch in `pagure.cfg`,
                              restart things and have everything work OOTB.

                              We already do that with other software we run.

                              Git branch. Feel free to close this issue when you drop
                              Python 2 support, or at any time. Thanks : )'

                            \ commits for them. [Gitlab bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/16491)\r\
                            \n- GitLab and GitHub both don't have very fine-grained\
                            \ access controls, so we're forced to ask for more access\
                            \ than we actually need.\r\n- For GitLab, we have to have\
                            \ SourceHut administration register an account with the\
                            \ GitLab instance and set up an OAuth client manually\

                              \ uses the [Open Build Service](https://openbuildservice.org),\
                              \ and the build system imposes what the `Release` value\

                            useful to have a link to the commit modifying the file
                            right above the file view, like how it's done on GitHub
                            and GitLab. This makes it easier to go straight from a
                            file to looking at the full context via clicking on the
                            commit associated with the version of the file being viewed.

                          content: "Today to validate a webhook payload a system needs\
                            \ to know the project's private token. The connector endpoint\
                            \ (that allow to read the webhook token) has been added\
                            \ recently but it requires the modify project ACL right\
                            \ and being a project admin. So a third party application\
                            \ will need admin access in order to read the token then\
                            \ validate and handle the payload.\r\n\r\nObviously, the\
                            \ token could be shared manually with the third party\
                            \ app operator, but if the application manages multiple\
                            \ projects then it is problematic.\r\n\r\nSo my idea is\
                            \ to create a new endpoint to read the webhook token for\
                            \ a given project but make it accessible to a project\
                            \ collaborator starting with the ticket access level.\r\
                            \nAs a project admin, to interact with a third party application,\
                            \ he will need to add third party app user as collaborator\
                            \ and set the webhook server url.\r\n\r\nFor instance\
                            \ on Github and Gitlab, the token is free form and one\
                            \ can be specified by webhook url. In the third party\
                            \ application configuration it is then possible to stick\
                            \ to an unique token, then tell project owners to use\
                            \ that given token. It seems this kind of integration\
                            \ is a bit flawed as someone that know that unique token\
                            \ could forge events for other projects. (Regarding a\
                            \ zuul third party app, projects to handle are defined\
                            \ in the zuul configuration so potential issues are mitigated).\r\
                            \n\r\nOn github, applications can be defined. So a third\
                            \ party application could interact with github repositories\
                            \ through the github application. When a github application\
                            \ is created the application owner get a webhook_token\
                            \ an app_id and an app_key. These token, id and key will\
                            \ be used by the third party application to interact with\
                            \ repositories/organisations that have added the github\
                            \ application. So here we see that if a project/organisation\
                            \ owner authorize a github app in its project/organisation\
                            \ then the third party application can easily validate\
                            \ the hook payload via the webhook_token.\r\n\r\nWhat\
                            \ do you think ? how could we manage to let third party\
                            \ applications deal more easily with payload validation\
                            \ ?"

                            \ tasks and thus people don't have to wait for too long\
                            \ when they want to, for example, fork a repository. However,\
                            \ if the repository is bigger (400 MiB - https://pagure.io/archlinux-packages),\
                            \ it is expected that the forking will take longer. And\
                            \ indeed, it does.\r\n\r\nCurrently Pagure automatically\
                            \ shows its \"sorry for inconvenience\" message (\"This\
                            \ is taking longer than usual... Sorry for that.\") after\
                            \ just couple of seconds of processing.\r\n\r\nThis is\
                            \ not bad per se, but it could leave people wondering\
                            \ whether there are some infra issues that should be reported\
                            \ somewhere.\r\n\r\nForking of larger repositories will\
                            \ always be slower and I am wondering if there is a way\
                            \ for Pagure how to be a bit smarter about those \"sorry\
                            \ for inconvenience\" messages. I think fork tasks go\
                            \ to \"slow celery queue\" by default so maybe have a\
                            \ different threshold for such \"slow\" tasks and different\
                            \ threshold for normal, quick tasks?\r\n\r\nWDYT?"

                              to do (an option in the settings, an if in the template
                              and in the actual endpoint)

                              \ is _second_ in the list of filter fields, after \"\
                              tags\". (That's second out of **SEVEN** separate filter\
                              \ fields, which seems far too granular to be useful\
                              \ to anyone other than the developers.) What audience\
                              \ is that even for, that filtering by tags would be\
                              \ given a higher priority than a general text search?\r\
                              \n\r\nIt's also not as useful a search as it could be.\
                              \ For instance, searching for my username in this repo\
                              \ turns up 0 results. It's only by _filtering_ for my\
                              \ username under \"Submitted by\", that my previous\
                              \ issues can be located. (If there are others I've commented\
                              \ on, before this one \u2014 I'm _pretty_ sure there\
                              \ are, but who can remember? \u2014 there is apparently\
                              \ no way to locate those at all.)\r\n\r\nFiltering options\
                              \ are fine, but they're usually applied _after_ searching,\
                              \ if too many results make the search unwieldy. But\
                              \ search should be able to match the contents of **_all_**\
                              \ of the filterable fields, in addition to text content."

                          content: "Today the PR vote system in Pagure is that anyone\
                            \ can add a :thumbsup: that will enable the merge button\
                            \ when the score threshold (defined in the setting) is\
                            \ reached. That's ok when an human, usually the project\
                            \ admins will click the merge button.\r\n\r\nIn the case\
                            \ where a bot acts as the gating system we might want\
                            \ to add another level of safety when computing the PR\
                            \ score to avoid the situation where the bot could merge\
                            \ a change w/o any review from main project maintainers.\r\
                            \n\r\nThe idea I want to propose is, in the project settings,\
                            \ add a group selector along with the \"minimal score\
                            \ to merge a PR\" field. Then the score computation will\
                            \ only consider :thumbsup:  from the users from the selected\
                            \ group. For instance only the 'pagure-maintainers' group\
                            \ users will have their :thumbsup: took in account. We\
                            \ can by default keep the same behaviour (:thumbsup: from\
                            \ everyone). But propose that group selector for advanced\
                            \ usecases.\r\n\r\nGerrit via the ACLs system can be set\
                            \ to allow only some people (or group) to set a note in\
                            \ a defined label. Github also let a project owner configure\
                            \ the a list of people (or a group) requested to review\
                            \ a PR before the PR can be merge."

                              You can subscribe to issues, but can't list issues subscribed
                              to by a user, you can only list issues opened by or
                              assigned to a specific user.

                            \ to see the same sorted view I see. For example, in a\
                            \ project, we use a `needs committer review` label for\
                            \ unreviewed PRs. I want to share a URL, either in a message\
                            \ or adding a link to our project docs, for others to\
                            \ help us review these specific PRs that need feedback\

                            ED25519 key that I use everywhere. The key shows up fine
                            in my account in the SSH keys tab, but when I fork a repo
                            it won't show me git URLs and insists that I need to upload
                            an SSH key to make pull requests.

                              \ experience using the web UI.\r\n\r\nThe issue is simply\
                              \ that the task system doesn't provide any information\
                              \ as to the state of the task. We're still using redis\
                              \ and it basically only provides: pending/running/done\
                              \ so that's all the information we can return the user.\r\
                              \n\r\nWe could tweak when the message about the task\

                            \ if the repository is bigger (400 MiB - https://pagure.io/archlinux-packages),\
                            \ it is expected that the forking will take longer. And\
                            \ indeed, it does.\r\n\r\nCurrently Pagure automatically\
                            \ shows its \"sorry for inconvenience\" message (\"This\

                            \ to \"slow celery queue\" by default so maybe have a\
                            \ different threshold for such \"slow\" tasks and different\
                            \ threshold for normal, quick tasks?\r\n\r\nWDYT?"

                              \ confusion; you're right, Debian does include the needed\
                              \ CSS files.  I now remember that I had investigated\
                              \ all this before, and came to the conclusion that Pagure\
                              \ on Debian would be able to use `libjs-highlight.js`.\
                              \  I think the only reason I created this bug is to\
                              \ let you guys know that upstream Pagure has this issue.\r\

                              \ issues can be located. (If there are others I've commented\
                              \ on, before this one \u2014 I'm _pretty_ sure there\
                              \ are, but who can remember? \u2014 there is apparently\
                              \ no way to locate those at all.)\r\n\r\nFiltering options\
                              \ are fine, but they're usually applied _after_ searching,\
                              \ if too many results make the search unwieldy. But\
                              \ search should be able to match the contents of **_all_**\

                              \ not enforce the docs to be of a certain type. The\
                              \ docs can be plain text, rst, md, or html files.\r\n\
                              So we would need a mechanism to potentially build docs\
                              \ on push and that means running arbitrary code uploaded\
                              \ by the user on a system, which, you know better than\
                              \ me, is not a small task :)"

                          content: While Pagure has a hook to automatically publish
                            to readthedocs, there is no corresponding functionality
                            for Pagure's own docs feature. It would be really nice
                            if this didn't have to be a manual step.

                          content: "Today the PR vote system in Pagure is that anyone\
                            \ can add a :thumbsup: that will enable the merge button\
                            \ when the score threshold (defined in the setting) is\
                            \ reached. That's ok when an human, usually the project\
                            \ admins will click the merge button.\r\n\r\nIn the case\
                            \ where a bot acts as the gating system we might want\
                            \ to add another level of safety when computing the PR\
                            \ score to avoid the situation where the bot could merge\
                            \ a change w/o any review from main project maintainers.\r\
                            \n\r\nThe idea I want to propose is, in the project settings,\
                            \ add a group selector along with the \"minimal score\
                            \ to merge a PR\" field. Then the score computation will\
                            \ only consider :thumbsup:  from the users from the selected\
                            \ group. For instance only the 'pagure-maintainers' group\
                            \ users will have their :thumbsup: took in account. We\
                            \ can by default keep the same behaviour (:thumbsup: from\
                            \ everyone). But propose that group selector for advanced\
                            \ usecases.\r\n\r\nGerrit via the ACLs system can be set\
                            \ to allow only some people (or group) to set a note in\
                            \ a defined label. Github also let a project owner configure\
                            \ the a list of people (or a group) requested to review\
                            \ a PR before the PR can be merge."

                              You can subscribe to issues, but can't list issues subscribed
                              to by a user, you can only list issues opened by or
                              assigned to a specific user.

                            \ project, we use a `needs committer review` label for\
                            \ unreviewed PRs. I want to share a URL, either in a message\

                              \ I noticed it on discourse first, and i think\r\nother\
                              \ git forges do it too. It gives other people some info\
                              \ on the state of\r\nthe poster. For example, i cant\
                              \ provide an image at the moment since im\r\nreplying\
                              \ by email, and that also means i may not be able to\
                              \ review PRs or\r\nmake quick fixes. What i can do is\
                              \ \"ack\" so others know ive read and am\r\naware of\
                              \ the discussion.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? A UX person\
                              \ may be able to explain it better XD\r\n"
